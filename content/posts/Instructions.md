Introduction

Welcome to your new _Hugo_ website!

Hugo parses **markdown** files like this one, and turns them into `html`.
Having an empty line-return between two sentences separates them into
paragraphs. Having no space between lines means content stays in the same
paragraph.

Use **stars** for bold and some _underlines_ for italics.

The rest you can Google. Lol. To make a new post type this:

```
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md
```
